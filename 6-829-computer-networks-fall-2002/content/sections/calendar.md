Please note:

1.  This course is structured in three modules: Internetworking and routing; Resource management; and Network services. The modules are inter-related.
2.  Lecture numbers (L1, L2, etc.) are linked to corresponding lecture notes. Generally, these will appear on this page soon after the lecture. Not all notes are in flowing text; usually they are in bullet form and highlight things I consider important about each paper or the area being discussed.
3.  For all lectures, you MUST try and read the assigned papers BEFORE lecture. I will not repeat a lot of detail of what's in the paper, but instead focus only on a few important pieces, and give you a flavor of other work in the area as well. You're likely to get the most out of each lecture if you read the material beforehand.
4.  Pay attention to the due dates for problem sets, project proposal, project interim status, and other deadlines. All deadlines are hard.
5.  The paper codes refer to papers found on the course-reading list.
6.  Paper codes in parentheses (e.g., **(RJ90)**) are optional reading. Read some of these if you have time, or are especially interested in the corresponding material. You'll learn a great deal and may find it useful for your project. We won't hand these papers out in class; in most cases, Web links are available.
